## Contributions
### Andrew Crossman:
Ensured PEP8 compliance. Explored and cleaned dataset. Adjusted parameters to ensure good scores.

### Ben Flaggs:
Created and fit with classifiers. Found four most important features. Some captions and descriptions made.

### Nik Korzoun:
Created confusion matrices. Assisted with fitting training data and testing scores with test data. Some captions and descriptions made.

### Connor Mooney:
Created loss functions. Assisted in finding beset four features. Plotted ROC curve. Some captions and descriptions made.

## Questions
1. This homework is about using different tree-based classification and regression algorithms to solve a problem on `kaggle.com` about higgs boson data.
2. The hardest part of this homework was finding what the optimal maximum depth was to use on the classifiers and regressors such that our results wer still decent.
3. The easiest part of this homework was finding the four most important features of the data.
4. I learned that the confusion matrices can show the true positive/negative and false positive/negative rates.
