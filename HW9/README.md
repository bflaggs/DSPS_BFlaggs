## Note
I did not realize until today (12/02/2021) that the original and deepdream files needed to be added to our README files as this instruction was not listed anyway on the HW9 README when I completed the homework.

## Questions
1. This homework was used to show how the deepdream algorithm works and how a neural network works in general.
2. The hardest part of this homework for me was trying to get the optional part of this homework to work (I still did not get it to work because it says data limits exceeded for the things being input to the `show_graph` function).
3. The easiest part of this homework for me was making the random RGB array.
4. One new thing I learned was the difference between the earlier and later layers of the deepdream algorithm.
