## Contributions
### Andrew Crossman:

Ensured PEP8 compliance and assisted with debugging.

### Ben Flaggs:
Assisted in preprocessing data. Calculated intracluster variance. Applied k-means clustering and plotted variance over number of clusters. Plotted k-means clusters on 2D projection.

### Nik Korzoun:

Assisted with intracluster variance and plotting variance over number of clusters. Created distance matrix, histogram of pairwise distances, and applied DBSCAN clustering to 2D TSNE projection.

### Connor Mooney:
Preprocessed the data. Plotted the TSNE projection. Created agglomerative clustering dendrograms and 2D agglomerative clusters plot.


## Questions
1. This homework was used to show how clustering methods apply to a dataset with many dimensions.
2. The hardest part of this homework for me was trying to understand exactly how the intracluster variance function code should work.
3. The easiest part of this homework for me was making the 2D projection plot.
4. One new thing I learned was `sklearn` has a built in k-means clustering algorithm along with other algorithms used for clustering (DBSCAN and agglomerative).
