## Contributions
### Andrew Crossman:
Imported, cleaned, and reshaped headshot images of training and test data for headshot assignment.

### Ben Flaggs:
Created loss vs epoch plots for digit assignment, created model using FFNN to reconstruct images of digits, and created figure captions for FFNN digit assignment.

### Nik Korzoun:
Created loss vs epoch plots for headshot assignment, created model with a given loss function and optimizer, and added many figure captions for headshot assignment.

### Connor Mooney:
Imported, cleaned, and reconstructed headshot image of Connor's headshot. Added some captions for headshot assignment.

## Questions
1. This homework is about testing neural networks to do different things. Specifically, we trained a neural network to decode a digit from an image which looks like a digit and we trained a separate neural network to increase the resolution of a person's headshot.
2. The hardest part of this homework was figuring out which parameters to set for our neural networks in order to get decent output loss functions. For example, which learning rate should we use, how many epochs, etc.
3. The easiest part of this homework was plotting the loss functions for each of the neural networks.
4. I learned that it is possible to encode large amounts of information into a much smaller amount (i.e. compressing a 784 dimensional dataset into a 64 dimensional dataset without losing much, if any, information). This is what we did in the digit encoder.
