## Questions
1. This homework was used to show how linear algebra is used when fitting data to a model and how to quantify uncertainties from the fits based on these linear algebra methods.
2. The hardest part of this homework for me was trying to understand exactly how the linear algebra works for the covariance matrix (used to get the uncertainties).
3. The easiest part of this homework for me was making the plots.
4. One new thing I learned was that `np.vander()` sets up a matrix with columns that are powers of the input matrix.
